# Enhanced Items
This extension modifies the item sheet to add some additional features like charges for wands and a gm-only notes field.
Original extension by [sciencephile](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/member.php?23086-sciencephile) with updates by [jwguy](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/member.php?26033-Jwguy), [llisandur](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/member.php?61628-Llisandur), [rmilmine](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/member.php?215591-rmilmine), and bmos.

# Compatibility
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) v4.3.5 (2023-03-07).

# Features
This extension modifies the item sheet to add some additional features:

* Add GM-only field added to all items for tracking notes not visible to players.
* Charges fields added for Wands and Staffs.
* Slot field added for Wondrous Items.
* Source field added to all items for tracking an item's sourcebook.
* Activation field for tracking what action is needed for use. Visible for Weapons, Armor, Shields, Staffs, and Wondrous Items.
* Weapon/Shield/Armor detection functions are now 'fuzzy' so "Armor" / "Armors" / "Armor and Defense" / etc will all detect as armor.

All of the type specific fields only display with the appropriate item type, the same as would originally happen with "Weapon" or "Armor" in the Type field.
